# Traffic Light Controller using C

This project is a real-time traffic light controller simulation developed using the C programming language. 
It continuously controls red, green, and yellow signals using loop logic and time delays.

## Features
- Continuous operation
- Red, Green, Yellow signal sequence
- Simple and efficient logic

## Concepts Used
- while loop
- Delay using sleep()
- Sequential execution
- Real-time simulation

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
   gcc traffic_light.c -o traffic
2. Run the executable:
   ./traffic

 ## Output
The following output shows the continuous operation of the traffic light controller.
The program repeatedly turns ON Red, Green, and Yellow lights in sequence,
simulating a real-time traffic signal system.
